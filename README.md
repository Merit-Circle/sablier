A protocol for money streaming. Start with our [FAQ](https://faq.sablier.finance) if you want to learn how Sablier works
at the high-level, and check our [docs](https://docs.sablier.finance) if you want to integrate it in your project.

| Package                                                   | Description                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`@sablier/dev-utils`](/packages/dev-utils)               | Dev utils to be shared across Sablier projects and packages       |
| [`@sablier/protocol`](/packages/protocol)                 | Money streaming protocol                                          |
| [`@sablier/shared-contracts`](/packages/shared-contracts) | Smart contracts to be shared across Sablier projects and packages |

## Usage :hammer_and_pick:

To compile the smart contracts, bootstrap the monorepo and open the package you'd like to work on. For example, here are the instructions for `@sablier/protocol`:

```bash
$ yarn run bootstrap
$ cd packages/protocol
$ truffle compile --all
$ truffle migrate --reset --network development
```

To verify the smart contracts on etherscan run the following in the `packages/protocol` folder:

```bash
npx truffle run verify Sablier --network rinkeby
```

Alternatively, if you simply want to use our apps, head to [pay.sablier.finance](https://pay.sablier.finance) to create streams and
[app.sablier.finance](https://app.sablier.finance) to withdraw from streams. You'll need an Ethereum wallet and some ERC20 tokens.

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a dependency manager and [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
